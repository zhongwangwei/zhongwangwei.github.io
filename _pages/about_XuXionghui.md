Name: Xionghui Xu

2024 - present: Ph.D. Student, Sun Yat-sen University

2022 - 2024: Graduate Student (Master's Program), Sun Yat-sen University

2018 - 2022: Undergraduate Student, Sun Yat-sen University

Xu successfully transitioned from a Master's to a Ph.D. student in Prof. Wei's group this year, through the successive postgraduate and doctoral program. Over the past two years as a Ph.D. student, he has learned a great deal but acknowledges the need for further effort in his studies. His current research focuses on the wetland module in land surface models. You might not find Xu in many places because he is often deeply engrossed in his wetland research. He seems to have a knack for uncovering bugs in the models.
