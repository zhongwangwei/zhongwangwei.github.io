The focus of my research is to enhance our understanding of Earth's water and carbon cycles. My academic journey began at the University of Tsukuba, where I studied eddy correlation measurement under Prof. Michiaki Sugita, earning my master's degree in April 2013. I then pursued my Ph.D. at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, specializing in Environmental Studies. Under the supervision of Prof. Kei Yoshimura, I completed my doctorate in March 2016. Following graduation, I joined Prof. Xuhui Lee's lab at Yale University as a postdoctoral researcher, where I worked on developing isotope-enabled Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models. In April 2018, I returned to the University of Tokyo as a project researcher. Subsequently, from May 2019, I worked as a scientific assistant with Prof. Dani Or at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.Currently, I hold dual positions: I am an Associate Professor in the School of Atmospheric Sciences at Sun Yat-Sen University and a Cooperative Research Fellow at the Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo. My research interests encompass global and regional meteorology, land surface and atmospheric hydrology, data assimilation, and applications of stable isotopes in environmental studies.
