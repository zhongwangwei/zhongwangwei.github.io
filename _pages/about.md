The focus of my research is to enhance our understanding of Earth's water and carbon cycles. My academic journey began at the University of Tsukuba, where I studied eddy correlation measurement under Prof. Michiaki Sugita, earning my master's degree in April 2013. I then pursued my Ph.D. at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, specializing in Environmental Studies. Under the supervision of Prof. Kei Yoshimura, I completed my doctorate in March 2016. Following graduation, I joined Prof. Xuhui Lee's lab at Yale University as a postdoctoral researcher, where I worked on developing isotope-enabled Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models. In April 2018, I returned to the University of Tokyo as a project researcher. Subsequently, from May 2019, I worked as a scientific assistant with Prof. Dani Or at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Currently, I hold dual positions: I am an Associate Professor in the School of Atmospheric Sciences at Sun Yat-Sen University and a Cooperative Research Fellow at the Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo. 

My research delves into the intricate dynamics of Earth's surface processes, employing a multi-faceted approach that combines numerical modeling and isotopic techniques.

Within the realm of land surface modeling, I investigate the complex interplay between land, atmosphere, and water. Through numerical simulations, I explore processes like evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff, aiming to understand how land surface characteristics influence the water cycle and climate.

Shifting focus to coastal zones, I employ hydrodynamic models to simulate the physical processes governing these dynamic environments. By capturing the interplay of tides, currents, and waves, I strive to comprehend the complexities of coastal systems and anticipate their response to various natural and anthropogenic forces, such as sea-level rise and storm surges.

Complementing these modeling efforts, I harness the power of stable isotopes as tracers to unravel the mysteries of environmental processes. Through isotopic analysis, I track the sources, pathways, and transformations of water and other substances, shedding light on phenomena like water movement, biogeochemical cycles, and past climate conditions.

By integrating these diverse approaches, I aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Earth's surface processes and their far-reaching implications. Ultimately, my research seeks to inform effective environmental management strategies and foster a more sustainable future for our planet.
