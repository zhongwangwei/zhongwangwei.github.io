Our research group, led by Associate Professor Zhongwang Wei, focuses on enhancing our understanding of Earth's surface water dynamics. We employ a multi-faceted approach that combines advanced numerical modeling techniques with innovative isotopic methods to unravel the complexities of the global water cycle.

## Research Focus

Our primary areas of investigation include:

1. **Land Surface Modeling**: We explore the intricate interactions between land, atmosphere, and water. Through sophisticated numerical simulations, we study processes such as evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff, aiming to understand how land surface characteristics influence the water cycle and climate dynamics.

2. **Coastal Hydrodynamics**: Utilizing state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models, we simulate the physical processes governing coastal environments. Our research captures the interplay of tides, currents, and waves, striving to comprehend the complexities of coastal systems and anticipate their responses to various natural and anthropogenic forces, including sea-level rise and storm surges.

3. **Isotope Hydrology**: We harness the power of stable isotopes as environmental tracers to unravel the mysteries of water movement and transformation. Through isotopic analysis, we track the sources, pathways, and alterations of water across various ecosystems, shedding light on hydrological processes, biogeochemical cycles, and paleoclimate conditions.

4. **Large Eddy Simulation (LES) Modeling**: Building on Prof. Wei's postdoctoral work, we develop and apply isotope-enabled LES models to study fine-scale atmospheric and hydrological processes, bridging the gap between micro-scale turbulence and larger-scale water cycle dynamics.

## Our Approach

By integrating these diverse approaches, our group aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Earth's surface water dynamics and their far-reaching implications. We emphasize interdisciplinary collaboration, leveraging expertise in atmospheric sciences, hydrology, geochemistry, and environmental studies.

Our research seeks to inform effective water resource management strategies, improve climate change adaptation measures, and foster a more sustainable future for our planet. We are committed to training the next generation of scientists equipped to tackle the complex challenges facing our global water systems.

## Collaboration and Opportunities

We maintain strong international collaborations, including ongoing partnerships with the University of Tokyo, Yale University, and ETH Zurich. Our group welcomes inquiries from potential graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and collaborators who share our passion for understanding and protecting Earth's water resources.
